# Introduction

This project aims to develop an ANN-based system to detect the sounds of various animals in different environments. The system will be trained on a large dataset of animal sounds collected from various sources, including zoos, wildlife sanctuaries, and natural habitats. The ANN will be designed to learn the features that are unique to different species and their environments, enabling it to distinguish between different animal sounds accurately.

# Alternative Approach
Alternative approach to improve the classification, we could use CNN for the same and we will pick it up in the following week as we were unable to implement the same in the given time.
We also plan to optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning

# Future Scope
1)Expansion of animal sound library: Adding more animal sounds to the training dataset could improve the system's accuracy and recognition capabilities.

2)Real-time monitoring and analysis: Integrating the system with live audio feeds from field sensors or drones could enable real-time monitoring and analysis of wildlife populations.

3)Integration with acoustic sensors: The system could be integrated with acoustic sensors to automatically trigger audio recording when a target animal sound is detected.

4)Multimodal data analysis: The system could be extended to analyze other types of data such as visual data from cameras or location data from GPS tags to provide a more comprehensive understanding of animal behavior and habitat use
